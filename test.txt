We are building a Chrome extension to act as a timer app that will only go off when you
finish the video/activity you are watching/doing.
User will input an amount of time they wish to take a break for (and maybe a max breaktime)
and the extension will pop up with a reminder to do a task (either "get back to task", or they 
can input a task name(s) possibly?)
